# :racehorse: Preact in (native) ES2015, _without_ Babel or JSX

[Preact] doesn't require that you use any sort of build tooling or transpiler.

This repo contains a simple example of how to use [Preact] in any modern ES2015 JavaScript environment. This includes the current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Node.JS.

Examples are included for both "Classful" Components, and stateless pure functional components.
