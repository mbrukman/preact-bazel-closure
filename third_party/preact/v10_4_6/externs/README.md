# Closure Compiler externs for Preact

This directory contains the `@externs` definitions for Preact v10.4.6 to enable
compilation of applications using Preact with the Closure Compiler via Bazel.

Since this was derived from Preact, the `@externs` file is under the same
license (MIT) as the original project.
